    "As a Product Owner pursuing a master's in geography, my research integrates economic approaches to spatial analysis. My academic background and role identity guide me to focus on the intersection of geographic and economic systems. I am particularly interested in how economic policies impact spatial distribution and regional development. My epistemological assumptions shape my understanding of these interactions, as I tend to view economic geography through a primarily quantitative lens. These positionalities inform my research goals and analyses, driving me to critically assess data while acknowledging that my assumptions may favor certain economic perspectives. This integrated approach allows me to contribute to nuanced insights within the sphere of geographic economics.",
