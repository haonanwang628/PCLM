My academic background and role identity guide me to focus on the intersection of geographic and economic systems. I am particularly interested in how economic policies impact spatial distribution and regional development. My epistemological assumptions shape my understanding of these interactions, as I tend to view economic geography through a primarily quantitative lens. These positionalities inform my research goals and analyses, driving me to critically assess data while acknowledging that my assumptions may favor certain economic perspectives. This integrated approach allows me to contribute to nuanced insights within the sphere of geographic economics.",

My technical background fuels my curiosity in understanding how technology reshapes economic landscapes and cultural practices. I am particularly drawn to ethical and societal implications, given my assumptions about technology as a neutral tool that can either exacerbate or alleviate economic disparities. This interdisciplinary approach influences my research, urging me to critically assess economic models within cultural contexts and question inherent biases. By acknowledging these dimensions, I aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of technology's role in society.",
