However, I recognize that my cultural and personal biases may influence my interpretation of data and findings. These biases stem from my experiences and perspectives, which can color my understanding of economic phenomena. Consequently, my positionality compels me to critically examine how my role and assumptions affect my research process, ensuring that I remain aware of potential blind spots while striving for objectivity in my analysis."
