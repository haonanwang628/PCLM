However, I recognize my biases stemming from ethical and societal assumptions inherent in my technical background, which may color my interpretations of anthropological data. This positionality compels me to critically examine how my experiences and perspectives influence my analysis, ensuring that I remain aware of the complexities within the subjects I study and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the human experience."
