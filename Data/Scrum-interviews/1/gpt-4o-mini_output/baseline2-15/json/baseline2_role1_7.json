I aim to explore how geographical factors influence economic outcomes, particularly in urban settings. However, I recognize that my epistemological assumptions may shape my interpretations, potentially leading me to prioritize quantitative data over qualitative insights. This positionality influences my research by framing my questions and analysis through a lens that may overlook alternative perspectives. By acknowledging these dimensions, I strive to approach my work with greater reflexivity, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between geography and economics."
