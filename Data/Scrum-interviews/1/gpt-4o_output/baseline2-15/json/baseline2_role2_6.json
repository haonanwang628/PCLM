My background in software development equips me with technical skills to analyze economic data, while my academic focus on statistics provides a solid foundation for quantitative research. However, I recognize that my cultural and personal biases may influence my interpretation of data, particularly in economic contexts. By acknowledging these biases, I strive to approach my research with a critical and reflective mindset, ensuring that my positionality informs, but does not unduly skew, my analysis and conclusions."
