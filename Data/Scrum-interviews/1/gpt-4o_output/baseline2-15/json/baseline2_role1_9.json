My background in product management informs my interest in the spatial dynamics of economic systems. I aim to explore how geographic factors influence economic development and decision-making. However, my epistemological assumptions may lead me to prioritize quantitative data and overlook qualitative insights. This positionality shapes my research by driving me to integrate economic theories with geographic analysis, while also challenging me to remain open to diverse methodologies and perspectives. My goal is to produce research that bridges these disciplines effectively."
