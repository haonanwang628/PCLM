My interest lies in understanding how economic systems influence societal structures and ethical considerations within digital communities. I recognize that my technical background may lead me to prioritize quantitative data and technological solutions, potentially overlooking qualitative cultural nuances. This awareness drives me to critically engage with my assumptions, ensuring a balanced approach. My positionality shapes my research by encouraging a multidisciplinary perspective, integrating technological insights with anthropological and economic theories to explore the ethical implications of digital economies."
