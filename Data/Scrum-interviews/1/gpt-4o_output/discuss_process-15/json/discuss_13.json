My research aims to understand how geographic factors influence economic development and policy. I acknowledge my epistemological assumptions, which may lead me to prioritize quantitative data and structured methodologies. This positionality shapes my research by guiding my focus on data-driven insights while remaining aware of the potential limitations of my perspective. By reflecting on these dimensions, I strive to conduct research that is both rigorous and inclusive, acknowledging the diverse factors that influence economic geography."
