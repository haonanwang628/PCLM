My research goal is to build reproducible, data-driven analyses that translate statistical evidence into policy-relevant economic insights. I acknowledge cultural and personal biases\u2014favoring algorithmic efficiency, market-oriented explanations, and English-language sources\u2014that shape what I read, model, and report. I reflect on how the question\u2019s framing and the user\u2019s response interact with my background to prioritize hypotheses, steer goals toward tractable problems, amplify biases, and narrow interpretations; thus I employ transparency, alternative specifications, and robustness checks to counterbalance these influences."
