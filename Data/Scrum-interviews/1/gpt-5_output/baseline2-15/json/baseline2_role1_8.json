I study economic geography to translate spatial-economic patterns into actionable insights for decision-makers. Epistemologically, I lean pragmatic-positivist: I privilege measurable evidence, causal inference, and implementable models, while recognizing their limits. This positionality leads me to frame questions around optimization and user value and to read user responses as requirements, which can underweight lived experience. I mitigate by triangulating quantitative analysis with participatory methods and reflecting on how question framing and responses shape interpretation."
