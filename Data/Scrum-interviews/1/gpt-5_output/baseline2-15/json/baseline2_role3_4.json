My disciplinary lens is Anthropology, while my primary research interest aligns with Economics, especially how market logics shape culture and labor. I carry ethical and societal assumptions about fairness, access, and responsibility in technology that sensitize me to power, inequality, and harm. The way this question is posed and my own response steer me toward operationalizable, data-driven text analysis and pragmatic interpretations; I foreground structure and incentives, which may obscure nuance, so I deliberately triangulate emic voices and reflexively audit my tools and interpretations."
