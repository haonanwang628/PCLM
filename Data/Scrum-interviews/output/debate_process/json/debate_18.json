    "target_text": "\"I\u2019m glad this is not an exam question! But to narrow it down, I see quality taking place in three levels: product, software code and the development process. I\u2019ll explain. The product quality is a functioning product free of defects and conforms with the business needs. Software code quality particularly in agile means clean code and a design that caters for future changes. In agile, we believe in responding to change over following a plan. It is important that we deliver a software that doesn\u2019t break each time the business wants a change. The process is important. Chaos doesn\u2019t deliver software, but a committed team and a strong process does. Agile believes in continuous learning and improvement. The software process becomes more robust when we learn from our mistakes and improve.\"",
